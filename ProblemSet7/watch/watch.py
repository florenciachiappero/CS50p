# In a file called watch.py, implement a function called parse that 
# expects a str of HTML as input, extracts any YouTube URL thatâ€™s the 
# value of a src attribute of an iframe element therein, and returns its 
# shorter, shareable youtu.be equivalent as a str. Expect that any such 
# URL will be in one of the formats below. Assume that the value of src 
# will be surrounded by double quotes. And assume that the input will 
# contain no more than one such URL. If the input does not contain any 
# such URL at all, return None.
