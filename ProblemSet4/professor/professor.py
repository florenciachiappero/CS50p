# In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

# Prompts the user for a level, . If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, 
# the program should prompt again.
# Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , 
# wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with  digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
# Prompts the user to solve each of those problem. If an answer is not 
# correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and 
# prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total. 
# If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the 
# program should output the correct answer.
# The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score, a number out of 
# 10.
