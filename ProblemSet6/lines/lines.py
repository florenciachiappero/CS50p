# In a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one 
# command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs 
# the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank 
# lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, 
# or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the 
# specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via 
# sys.exit.

# Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by 
# whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a 
# comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
